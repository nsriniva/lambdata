Review for Srini's helper_functions.py

Hi Srini,

Great, clean code. Effective use of docstrings and comments. 
I like that you chose a complicated function like the state abbreviations challenge, 
and also thanked a couple people for inspiration. 

I did have some trouble following the logic of the state abbreviations code. 
I read it several times before getting a grasp on how it worked. Perhaps some more writing
in layman's terms would help. I tested out abbr_2_st('Texas', True)
to see what would happen, but got an error message. I will chat with you on Slack about this,
because I am very interested in seeing how this function works!

Also did not realize that a second function you wrote outside
of helper_functions was also involved (for awhile I wondered if this was a widespread
library I didn't know about). I don't know if it is necessary to comment that 
you created that function and where to find it, but I think it's nice to know.

As usual, I learned a lot from reading your code. Thank you for sharing!
