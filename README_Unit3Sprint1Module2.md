I couldn't see any way to introduce a class for what i've implemented in helper_functions.py, however i did
create a class in oop/autos.py

As to helper_functions.py, i did
(1) make sure it's PEP8 compliant by running it through autopep8
and
(2) run it through pylint and cleaned up all the warnings.
To verify that the package has been built and uploaded to TestPyPi please run lambdata_test.ipynb in Colab.

Have also reviewed Temsy's code and submitted a PR :
